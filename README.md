# Vernancio x Warhol's Pokemon Soup

This project was inspired by the massive commercialization of art legends such as [Andy Warhol](https://www.warhol.org). Not being much of a Pokemon fan(I'm glad to know I'm not alone.) I dug deep into my creative bank and nothing! Then the idea hit me the day of presentations at 3:45am while looking in my cabinet for food. Once I saw a nutrition label all I saw was Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup art collection. The rest is history. Also, my choice for naming my trainer Vernancio was a homage to my part Filipino hertiage. Vernancio means Hunter(perfect fit huh?).

I pulled data via an AJAX call from a JSON file. I could've retrieved data directly from the Pokeman API however their servers are not fans of multiple requests so the JSON file was the most reliable alternative.
