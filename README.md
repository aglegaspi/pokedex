# Vernancio x Warhol's Pokemon Soup

This project was inspired by the recent commercialization of art legends such as [Andy Warhol](https://www.warhol.org). Not being a Pokemon fan I dug deep into my creative bank and the idea hit me at 3:45am while looking in my cabinet for food. I saw a nutrition label and connected the dots to Warhol's famous Campbell soup art and the rest was history.
